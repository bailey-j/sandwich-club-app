# Sandwich Club Project - Udacity Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it was selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing helps the developer better understand how JSON is processed.

## What Did I Learn?
Through this project, I:
- Practiced JSON parsing to a model object
- Designed an activity layout
- Populated all fields in the layout accordingly
